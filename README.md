## About The Project

### Overview
Empress Semgrep rules are crafted for the Empress Framework. They help detect typical errors and poor practices when developing Empress Framework applications. The rules automate repetitive checks during the code review process, boosting coding efficiency and enhancing code quality.

### Key Features
- Automatic validation of changes with semgrep rules on all PRs.
- Protection against common coding errors and poor practices.
- Simplification and acceleration of the code review process.

### Built With
Empress Semgrep Rules are developed with:
- [Semgrep](https://semgrep.dev/)

## Technical Stack and Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10
- Semgrep

### Installation And Usage
Follow these steps to set up a development environment:

1. Install Python, and verify that Semgrep is working:
```sh
semgrep --version
```
2. Clone the rules repository:
```sh
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/empress-eco/semgrep_rules.git empress-semgrep-rules
```
3. Run Semgrep specifying rules folder as config:
```sh
semgrep --config=~/path/to/empress-semgrep-rules/rules your_app_folder
```
Tip: You can optionally pass `--severity=ERROR` to ignore rules that produce warnings and only catch errors.

## Usage

The Empress Semgrep Rules can be integrated into your GitHub Actions to automatically validate changes with semgrep rules on all PRs. This allows for seamless and efficient code review, ensuring high-quality code and reducing the likelihood of common errors and poor practices.
